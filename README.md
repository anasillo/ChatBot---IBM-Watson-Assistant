The virtual assistant #Beto answers questions for the fictional restaurant "Lo del Bot". You can ask him about our menus, general questions (place, time, parking, etc.), or even make a reservation!

Why is a ChatBot important for a company? Because compared to a regular or full-time employee, a virtual assistant costs less, is more efficient, and it works 24/7.
